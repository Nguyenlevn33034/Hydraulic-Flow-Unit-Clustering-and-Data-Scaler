### In the petroleum engineering industry, permeability is one of the important parameters that receive a lot of attention for the effective exploitation process. Based on permeability, petroleum engineers can calculate and select methods. Proper exploitation brings high performance. Normally permeability will be determined through Routine Core Analysis – RCA but core sampling is quite limited and performing standard core sample tests will likely destroy the sample. “A commonly applied solution is to predict permeability using the traditional seepage void model. However, this solution can only be applied to reservoirs containing homogeneous sandstones; for reservoirs with high heterogeneity or complex hollow channel systems, applying the traditional permeable void model for the formation Permeability prediction results are not very reliable.”

### Hydraulic flow unit (HFU) is one of the practical methods for reservoir simulation. HFU is defined as the volume of rock associated with similar petroleum and geological physical properties with similar fluid flow. HFU's concept was developed to integrate geotechnical and petroleum engineering data to estimate the permeability of the core sample area and then use that result for the non-core sample area.
